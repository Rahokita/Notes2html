# Notes Document Converter
### Overview

An internal tool can convert a Notes database into HTML files.
However, the file and folder names generated by this tool are based on the Notes document IDs.  
Each HTML file is stored in a folder named after its corresponding document ID,
 which makes it difficult to locate the file you want to read.

### How Notes2html Helps

The internal tool also produces CSV files that list document IDs and document titles.  
Notes2html reads these CSV files and generates the HTML files in a more accessible format.

## How to Use

1. Prepare the Notes document list files.  
   The internal tool generates the following three CSV files (file names are fixed):
   - `Document.csv`
   - `Response.csv`
   - `Response to Response.csv`

2. Execute `Notes2html.py`.  
   The HTML files will be generated.
